# Compressor-Stage-Design
Design last stage of Axial LPC, having specified requirements.
Design LPC last stage to have pressure rise of 1.2. Geometric parameters are : tip diameter = 0.75m, hub-tip radius ratio = 0.5 and operating Absolute Mach number= 0.5.
Limiting Tip mach number to 1, search for optimal solution in design space satisfying constraits.

Use standard python libraries : numpy, scipy, xlwt, xlrd, matplotlib, math and os.
